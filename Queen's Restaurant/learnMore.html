A basic understanding of, and training in, culinary technique / basic food science.

If I absolutely had to single out a (well three, really) common household ingredient(s), it would be salt, sugar and butter.

We routinely add a bit of salt to sweet preparations, a bit of sugar to savoury ones, and a bit of butter to anything where it wouldn't hurt.

We're not even talking huge amounts, here, but just a little dash can really deepen or round out the flavour profile of pretty much any dish that's otherwise nice, but lacking a certain oomph.

Acidic ingredients (be they vinegar, lemon juice or whatever) are a close second. If something tastes 'dull’, adding a tiny bit of acidity to it can go a long way…

On the less-practical-for-home-gamers front, fonds, stocks and so on are a game changer. It's practical for a restaurant to produce and stock a variety, to be used as needed, but much less so at home in a typical household kitchen. Replacing water with an appropriate fond in pretty much any recipe (except for boiling potatoes, pasta or rice, maybe) will give that preparation a serious leg up.

At home, I use Vegeta brand 'vegetable stock’ powder and Knorr brand powdered beef and chicken ‘stock’ quite frequently. Not when I need or want actual stock (then, I either buy the preserved stuff in glasses, filch a litre or two from work, or bite the bullet and actually make some), but as a reasonably cheap and easy way to add a little kick to… quite a few preparations, really. Nowhere near as good as the real thing, but I live in a modestly-sized flat, and can't add plentiful freezer space, no matter how much I'd like to.

And, yes, what makes that work is monosodium glutamate (aka MSG, aka glutamate, aka the evil poison the food industry is trying to kill us all with). Being trained in basic food science, restaurant chefs know it for what it is: a molecule that is (mainly) responsible for what we perceive as rich, savoury, deep taste. Umami, if you must

Most traditional cuisines tend to go to great lengths to add it to their 'signature dishes’. Meat/bone broths and -stocks are chock-full of it, as are aged cheeses of all descriptions. Tomato (paste), mushrooms, onions, carrots, celer(y/iac) etc. pp. release a fair bit when sweated/roasted, are reasonably cheap and easy to obtain. That's why most savoury basic preparations in western cuisines include (one or more of) those.

Asian cuisines (to my limited knowledge) tend to use fermented condiments for the purpose more, and there were always also some of those in Western cuisines.

And, of course, there's been isolated MSG for rather a while. It's cheap, easy to use, and overused in industrially prepared foods. It makes up an appreciable part of those powdered 'stocks’. It can get noxious if overused, but isn't, in and by itself, evil, unhealthy or whatnot…

Well, I'd see this little excursion as a decent case being made for restaurant chefs and cooks simply knowing their stuff, which is culinary technique and basic food science. It's all in the training, really.
